2. **Agentic Workflows** - AI agents that understand context and generate production-ready code
3. **Multi-File Editing** - Simultaneous updates across multiple files with type safety
4. **Intelligent Refactoring** - Context-aware refactoring with AI assistance
5. **Integrated Testing** - Automated test generation and execution

### 1. Spec-Driven Development

Kiro's spec-driven approach was instrumental in building AIWA AI's complex features. I created comprehensive specs for all major features:

#### Prompt Analyzer Spec

**Requirements Phase:**

- Defined user stories with EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Created acceptance criteria for real-time analysis
- Specified scoring algorithms (strength, clarity, specificity)

**Design Phase:**

- Architected React hooks for real-time analysis
- Designed component structure (PromptAnalyzer, ScoreDisplay, SuggestionPanel)
- Defined TypeScript interfaces and data models
- Established correctness properties for score calculations

**Implementation Phase:**

- Kiro's AI agents generated the initial component structure
- Implemented scoring algorithms with Kiro's assistance
- Created unit tests and integration tests
- Refined based on Kiro's suggestions

#### Project Management Spec

**Requirements Phase:**

- Multi-tenant architecture requirements
- Environment variable security specifications
- Project-chat relationship modeling

**Design Phase:**

- Database schema design with Drizzle ORM
- API route architecture
- Security and access control patterns

**Implementation Phase:**

- Generated database migrations with Kiro
- Implemented API routes with error handling
- Created React components for project UI
- Added comprehensive test coverage

#### Export Functionality Spec

**Requirements Phase:**

- GitHub API integration requirements
- ZIP generation with environment variables
- Error handling and edge cases

**Design Phase:**

- GitHub OAuth flow design
- File structure for ZIP exports
- Environment variable injection strategy

**Implementation Phase:**

- Kiro generated GitHub API integration code
- Implemented ZIP generation with JSZip
- Added progress indicators and error handling
- Created end-to-end tests

### 2. Agentic Workflows

Kiro's AI agents were used extensively throughout development:

#### Code Generation

```typescript
// Example: Kiro generated this prompt analysis function
export function analyzePrompt(text: string): PromptAnalysis {
  // Strength: Based on length, specificity, and action verbs
  const strength = calculateStrength(text)

  // Clarity: Based on sentence structure and ambiguity
  const clarity = assessClarity(text)

  // Specificity: Based on technical terms and details
  const specificity = measureSpecificity(text)

  return {
    strength,
    clarity,
    specificity,
    suggestions: generateSuggestions(text, { strength, clarity, specificity }),
  }
}
```

**Kiro's agents helped generate:**

- React components with TypeScript
- API routes with error handling
- Database schemas with Drizzle ORM
- Test suites with Vitest
- Utility functions and helpers

#### Refactoring

**Authentication System Refactoring:**

- Kiro refactored the entire authentication flow
- Updated 15+ files simultaneously
- Ensured type safety across all changes
- Generated migration scripts for database changes

**Component Structure Optimization:**

- Reorganized component hierarchy
- Extracted reusable components
- Improved prop types and interfaces
- Added proper error boundaries

#### Testing

**Kiro generated comprehensive test suites:**

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Property-based tests for algorithms

### 3. Multi-File Editing

Kiro's multi-file editing capabilities were game-changing:

**Example: Implementing Project-Based Workflow**

When implementing the project-based workflow, Kiro edited 20+ files simultaneously:

1. **Database Schema** (`lib/db/schema.ts`)
   - Added project_ownership table
   - Updated chat_ownership with project_id foreign key
   - Created indexes for performance

2. **API Routes** (5 files)
   - `app/api/projects/route.ts` - List projects
   - `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` - Get/update project
   - `app/api/projects/[id]/chats/route.ts` - Project chats
   - Updated chat routes to support project association

3. **React Components** (8 files)
   - ProjectList, ProjectCard, ProjectForm
   - Updated ChatInterface to show project context
   - Added ProjectSelector dropdown
   - Environment variable management UI

4. **TypeScript Types** (3 files)
   - Project interface
   - Updated Chat interface
   - API response types

5. **Tests** (4 files)
   - Project API tests
   - Component tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests

**All changes were:**

- Type-safe across the entire codebase
- Consistent in naming and patterns
- Properly tested
- Documented with JSDoc comments

### 4. Debugging & Optimization

Kiro helped identify and fix numerous issues:

**Performance Optimization:**

- Identified unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Suggested useMemo and useCallback optimizations
- Optimized database queries with proper indexes
- Implemented connection pooling

**Security Improvements:**
